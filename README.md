# Personal Project Showcase App

A responsive single-page application (SPA) built in React to allow users to add, search, and manage personal projects in a simple portfolio-style interface.

---

## Features

- **Add New Projects**  
  Users can enter a project title and description to dynamically add new projects to the portfolio list.

- **Controlled Form Inputs**  
  All form inputs are fully controlled using React state, ensuring proper validation and state updates.

- **Form Validation**  
  Prevents adding empty projects by requiring both title and description before submission.

- **Project List Rendering**  
  Dynamically displays all added projects as cards.

- **Delete Functionality**  
  Each project card includes a delete button to remove the project from the list.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Real-time filtering of the project list based on the user's search query.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The entire application is mobile-friendly, centered, and scales cleanly across different screen sizes.

- **Component-Based Architecture**  
  Application is broken down into fully reusable components:

  - `App`
  - `Header`
  - `ProjectForm`
  - `SearchBar`
  - `ProjectList`
  - `ProjectCard`

- **First Time Using Tailwind CSS**  
  This project was styled using Tailwind CSS, marking our first implementation of Tailwindâ€™s utility-first design system.

  - Allowed rapid, clean styling directly in component code.
  - Made it simple to manage spacing, width control, and responsive layout.
  - Perfectly matched the provided mockup with fine-grained width control (`max-w-[400px]` pattern).

- **Custom Width Locking to Match Mockup**  
  Applied consistent layout constraints to fully match design specifications by controlling outer width in parent container and allowing child components to flow naturally.
